    <p>A great flank steak marinade like this one is important 
        if you want a tender, juicy, flavorful steak. 
        Make sure you marinate your flank steak for at least 2 hours for best results 
        or longer if you have time. This wonderful quick and easy recipe also works 
        great when the steak is sliced and used for fajitas.
